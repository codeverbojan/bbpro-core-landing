For 16 years, I worked with the company that marketed the BankSITE® brand. In 2022, I began building BBPro — a proprietary WordPress-based platform that now powers over 100 U.S. bank websites.

I developed the BBPro Core Framework entirely myself: architecture, updates, deployment, and support.

There was never a written license, employment agreement, or copyright assignment.
